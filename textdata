  Purchased this product advertised as fully unlocked. Inserted my sim card and it did not work. Contacted my service provider and they checked my IMEI number and it reported that the phone was still locked by the original carrier. Phone came in good condition just couldn't use any service provider.

  I was feeling a bit skeptical after I placed my order but I was proven wrong! The phone looks brand new besides some very minimal/ light scratches (almost impossible to notice) and the battery life is still at 100%. I also like that there was a screen protector on the phone

"  This is the best experience I have ever had with buying a renewed phone. The phone came in itâ€™s original box with original charger and cable and the phone looks excellent, not one scratch on it absolutely beautiful and the battery health was at 100%. I definitely recommend the seller GoOverstock, as I will definitely be buying from them again."

"  I fought it for the longest time but I finally gave in and upgraded to the iPhone 11 from the iPhone 7. I looked other places online, but the price was way out of my price point. I felt comfortable buying this phone from Amazon because it was certified refurbished and Iâ€™m still happy that I did."

  The box didnâ€™t come with ear phones. The phone kept turning off by itself after set up. Some apps had to be deleted before theyâ€™d quit shutting off on their own.

"  My iPhone came with a big scuff on the corner (aluminum frame)  and a small (not really noticible) scratch on the front and back of the phone. I got the 64 gb product red unlocked iPhone 11 which was, I believe a Verizon unlocked phone. My phone came in the iPhone 11 apple box with a original apple charger and original apple brick.  When I set up my phone I just put in my T-Mobile sim and the phone started working with my data. I did not need to get it activated or anything."

I will be doing a month review on this phone for more updates. Brand new and unlocked Iâ€™m paired with cricket so everything transferred over so easily!"
  Purchased this product advertised as fully unlocked. Inserted my sim card and it did not work. Contacted my service provider and they checked my IMEI number and it reported that the phone was still locked by the original carrier. Phone came in good condition just couldn't use any service provider.
  I was feeling a bit skeptical after I placed my order but I was proven wrong! The phone looks brand new besides some very minimal/ light scratches (almost impossible to notice) and the battery life is still at 100%. I also like that there was a screen protector on the phone
  Phone was not unlocked could it use it
  The screen came cracked and popped out of the frame. Hopefully the return process goes smoothly.
"  This is the best experience I have ever had with buying a renewed phone. The phone came in itâ€™s original box with original charger and cable and the phone looks excellent, not one scratch on it absolutely beautiful and the battery health was at 100%. I definitely recommend the seller GoOverstock, as I will definitely be buying from them again."
  Be careful mine had a scratch on screen very small but still ðŸ˜¢ their Used. People dont want used I phones with scratches
"  I fought it for the longest time but I finally gave in and upgraded to the iPhone 11 from the iPhone 7. I looked other places online, but the price was way out of my price point. I felt comfortable buying this phone from Amazon because it was certified refurbished and Iâ€™m still happy that I did."
  The box didnâ€™t come with ear phones. The phone kept turning off by itself after set up. Some apps had to be deleted before theyâ€™d quit shutting off on their own.
"                    The media could not be loaded.                  Â I just wanna tell everybody this is NOT A SCAM!!!! This phone is so amazing, great battery life, Face ID everything. Unfortunately mine didnâ€™t come in an iPhone box but I was too much worried about that but it did come w/ a charger . Please get this phone  donâ€™t let any of these reviews scare you! I will be doing a month review on this phone for more updates. Brand new and unlocked Iâ€™m paired with cricket so everything transferred over so easily!"
"  My iPhone came with a big scuff on the corner (aluminum frame)  and a small (not really noticible) scratch on the front and back of the phone. I got the 64 gb product red unlocked iPhone 11 which was, I believe a Verizon unlocked phone. My phone came in the iPhone 11 apple box with a original apple charger and original apple brick.  When I set up my phone I just put in my T-Mobile sim and the phone started working with my data. I did not need to get it activated or anything."

I definitely recommend the seller GoOverstock, as I will definitely be buying from them again."
  Be careful mine had a scratch on screen very small but still ðŸ˜¢ their Used. People dont want used I phones with scratches
"  I fought it for the longest time but I finally gave in and upgraded to the iPhone 11 from the iPhone 7. I looked other places online, but the price was way out of my price point. I felt comfortable buying this phone from Amazon because it was certified refurbished and Iâ€™m still happy that I did."
  The box didnâ€™t come with ear phones. The phone kept turning off by itself after set up. Some apps had to be deleted before theyâ€™d quit shutting off on their own.
  Purchased this product advertised as fully unlocked. Inserted my sim card and it did not work. Contacted my service provider and they checked my IMEI number and it reported that the phone was still locked by the original carrier. Phone came in good condition just couldn't use any service provider.
  I was feeling a bit skeptical after I placed my order but I was proven wrong! The phone looks brand new besides some very minimal/ light scratches (almost impossible to notice) and the battery life is still at 100%. I also like that there was a screen protector on the phone
  Phone was not unlocked could it use it
  The screen came cracked and popped out of the frame. Hopefully the return process goes smoothly.
"  This is the best experience I have ever had with buying a renewed phone. The phone came in itâ€™s original box with original charger and cable and the phone looks excellent, not one scratch on it absolutely beautiful and the battery health was at 100%. I definitely recommend the seller GoOverstock, as I will definitely be buying from them again."
